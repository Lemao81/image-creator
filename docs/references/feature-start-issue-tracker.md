# Starting a feature

1. `/grill-with-docs <idea>`: answer the numbered question rounds until every decision is settled. Resolved terms go into `GLOSSARY.md`, decisions that are hard to reverse into `docs/adr/`.
2. `/to-spec`: confirm the proposed test seams; the conversation becomes `.scratch/<feature>/spec.md`.
3. `/to-tickets`: approve the tracer-bullet breakdown; it becomes one issue file per ticket with its blockers, and `plan.md` is written alongside.
Each stage is committed only when the user says so.

# Issue tracker

Issues, specs and plans live as local markdown files under `.scratch/<feature>/`; details in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.
- Issues are sized by feature, never shrunk to fit one commit. Each has acceptance criteria and lists its work as numbered `## Steps`; one step is exactly one commit.
- `plan.md` has one heading per issue, linking its file, with its steps below as checkboxes (`- [ ] 1.1 Step title`) in execution order. 📦 marks a step that edits `package.json`.
- Decisions that must wait until work starts go under `## Open decisions (ask the user before starting)`.
